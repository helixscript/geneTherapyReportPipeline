\title{Calculation for descriptors of populations}
\usage{
pop_calcs(x, calc)

calc_shannon(x, base = exp(1))

calc_gini(x, wt = NULL)

calc_entropy(x)

calc_clonality(x)

calc_uc50(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric a vector of abundances or proportions / frequencies.}

\item{calc}{character one of the various population calcuations. Choices are:
"shannon", "gini", "entropy", "clonality", or "uc50".}
}
\description{
Given a population of integration sites, TCR/IGH sequences,
etc., a numerical value can be used to describe the diveristy (shannon index
or entropy), or the clonality (gini or clonality). These numerical values
allow for a comparison to be made between populations. Entropy and Clonality
are factors used by Adaptive Biotechnologies to describe their TCR / IGH
sequence data.
